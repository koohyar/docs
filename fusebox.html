<h2>A parser, any parser!</h2>
<p>There had been heated arguments near a cache the other day. There was some sort of incident, nothing serious, it was more the cleanup that caused all the heat. See, a blue scope had gotten called by reference. Points in check, parsing complete, nothing lacking. However, when pointers started pulling, most of an afternoon's work started loading, almost tangent to the main scope. Nobody paniced, of course. There are routines, checks, reconfs. Nothing is wrong when parsing is complete. But the foresaken non-blue points (Yes, points, not scopes!) started zipping everything around them while everyone else was waiting in stand for the reconf to take place.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; saveobj
Checking feature... done.
</pre></div>
<p>Now zipping, in case you are not much familiar, does not really change stuff. If anything, it makes it more difficult for the rest of us to move around and we have to keep bumping into one another until something catches us. So when members of your own scope do it, you keep it formal. No unnecassary exchange, no painting, we wait to be caught. But the non-blue points had to panic around and call one zipping mayhem of encodings. Goddamn signal traps were not catching anything. It was no pretty experience.</p>
<p>Worse is every morning we see hints in shelves asking everyone to keep referring to them as <strong>non-blue points</strong> until the color shift is back and you can request an actual log. Nobody does it though. By the time you file a log the inherent bunch of left-aligned upright cyclists have turned your whole scope into a shared object, just because some nauseated environment variable <em>did not properly transpose</em>! It's a waste of free energy to file the logs. It is easier to keep to your format so you don't regress. At least other points won't nerve your scopes.</p>
