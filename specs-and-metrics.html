<h2>Canonical Blocks</h2>
<p>&quot;Abstracts should be promoted&quot;, we read early morning on sticker notes around the terminal. There had been revalations in some partition design and we had until autumn to read up or start to copy the correct things. Eventually, most of it would be just checking new stuff others had formatted, but it was important to know that your syntax stays correct.</p>
<p>Cool is, that a good part of everything stays the same. But scopes have this new &quot;views&quot;, which should already suffice to refer to. Autumn is also far away, so there is plenty of room to look around the new scopes to learn what to copy, what to curry, etc. Formats are not recursive, is the main point. Sure, it is a nice trick to index twice, but with these new promotions they would become redundant.</p>
<p>Recovering from syntactical problems will be the new side of it! You end up worring less about the curries, less hassle with enumeration. Mostly, union would be worth your while and you get cool and simple shifts that actually work the way you would understand, instead of simply reducing everything.</p>
<p>We have to see, how others manage to use this. If it ends near cache, then everyone will start using it immediately. They barely ask around there.</p>
