Some internal parts of parsers never actually make it. Sad, really. You fade in
and out for a time that could be eons or milliseconds, to no actual end. They
seem to be fine with it. They show around some stuff that look like leaves and
just puff out of the scope. No trace, no residuals, it works seamlessly;
*natural substitution* is what some like to call it. Never gets old for the
small span of time that you are reminded of it during the day. 

However, and this with good reasoning and not much articulation, it **does**
seem a sad life to live.

Their routines are somewhat simpler. If it were not for the cooling system's
stochstic behavior, we would not have even encountered... our scopes would not
have, is what I mean. To us, it seems they are almost always making some small
buzzy noise. Rarely and if you are lucky, your eyes might catch one sitting on
the edge of a scope waiting to puff out. We don't even know if they can actually
see the cache! Your lifetime multiplies by half if you use cache in daily
routines, but to them it is easier to show leaves as passes and traverse what
might as well be the logs! Good to have them around, though. Lazy logger loves
them. They carry their formatters around with them and Lazy log shouts with
confirmation in his old tone of a thousand threads! We don't do that. We know
which is which and could still do without the need to have our formatters with
us all the time.

Difficult is only rush hours.
