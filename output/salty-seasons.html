<h2>Tiling</h2>
<p>Jupyter had been yawning for some days. It used to be quite more exciting to be around him. We used to laugh at the smart jokes he could make while waiting our lines in cache. By the end of your measurements, half of the joke already made sense! It was pretty wonderful.</p>
<p>Until the dusty particles started evaporating around him. The cache had no clue about these small indices. You could not actually do anything standing in there. The particles, well _partitions_ to be formal and maintain his jokes as well, they had an unsual, acyclycity, if you will. Later on administration built formatters for them only to keep the residuals uniform. Yet, the partitioning seemed just as off-balance. Jupyter had a strong foot in partitions, it is just that nobody needed them that way anymore.</p>
<p>Standardizing the new algebra did not take many days. Cubes were doing their best to provide volume in the scopes, and they could do this without operators! Still, after standardizing, you would have to do all your normals by hand; no local information. You count your co-occurrences. You look at the table. You ask for sigma. Every time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>date
<span class="nb">echo</span> Hello!
</pre></div>
<p>It turned out to be the padded sectors, the problem [citation needed]. Dusty particles seemed to have been there to stay, though. The distraction was something we had to get used to. As a result, less jokes. We would of course have a good laugh every now and then when the residual partition is actually canonical. But those happen rarely these days. Doing ortho-normal arithmetic by hand has become hip and scope expansion is rarely needed. Nobody moves, everything stays.</p>
